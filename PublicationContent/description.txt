[h1]Is it possible to make the game harder?[/h1]
It will be more efficient to use ServerExt together with other mutators (which add new zeds or game modes).
You can use [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2085786712/4241773359647296750/]my experience[/url][/u] or come up with something of your own.

[h1]If not working[/h1]
Older versions of Server-Ext have the same file names - this can cause conflicts if you subscribe to them. Therefore:
1. Check your subscriptions. If you are subscribed to old versions of the mutator, cancel them.
2. Clear the cache (the game doesn't clear it). It's here:
[code]
Client:
C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Cache\

Server:
<KF2_DIR>/Binaries/Win64/steamapps/workshop/content/232090/
<KF2_DIR>/KFGame/Cache/
[/code]
If it’s not a problem for you to download all subscriptions again, you can simply clear this folder(s). Your subscriptions are downloaded the next time you start the game/server.
If you do not want to download the subscriptions again, delete only those folders that contain the files:
[code]
ServerExt.u
ServerExtMut.u
[/code]
3. Reinstall ServerExt and try again.

[h1]Localization[/h1]
ServerExt supports localization now!

There is only english and russian localization, but if you have a desire to help translate ServerExt into other languages, you can read how to do it in this thread: [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2085786712/2942494909176752884]Localization[/url][/u]
